Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that provided key insights into road safety, including primary KPIs such as Total Current Year Casualties, Total Current Year Accidents, and Current Year Fatal, Serious, and Slight Casualties.
Utilized slicers to allow stakeholders to easily filter data by road and weather conditions, and created interactive visualizations including a map chart showing the location of accidents and donut charts highlighting the distribution of accidents by urban/rural and day/night.
Created secondary KPIs for different vehicle types and a bar chart showing casualties by road type, providing stakeholders with a more detailed view of road safety trends.
Implemented data cleaning and transformation processes to ensure accurate and reliable reporting, and used DAX measures to enhance the functionality of the dashboard and provide additional insights.
